"""Interaction engine — computes joint effects under declared interactions.

Core operations
---------------
``triggered(failed_set)``
    Which declared interactions are fully contained in *failed_set*.

``joint_effect(failed_set)``
    Total effect = Σ first-order + Σ triggered Δ, with ceiling applied.

``augment(failed_set, new_failure)``
    Monotonic extension — add *new_failure* and return the new triggered set
    and cumulative effect.  Union semantics guarantees I-4 (monotonicity).

The engine is stateless: every method takes the full declaration and returns
a fresh result.  Stateful usage (e.g. tracking a running failure set) is the
caller's responsibility.
