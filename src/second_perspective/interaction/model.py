"""Interaction model — types and declarations.

An *interaction* is a named relationship among two or more assumptions such
that the joint effect of their simultaneous failure differs from the sum of
each failing alone.

Conventions
-----------
E(I)  = joint effect of interaction I
e(h)  = first-order effect of assumption h
Δ(I)  = interaction strength  =  E(I) − Σ e(h)

Δ > 0  → CONJUNCTIVE  (amplification: failure together is worse)
Δ < 0  → DISJUNCTIVE  (redundancy: failure together is less than sum)
Δ = 0  → DEGENERATE   (no interaction; retained to prove "we checked")
