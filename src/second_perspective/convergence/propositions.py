"""Propositions — formally-stated, independently verifiable claims.

Each proposition function takes the relevant inputs and returns either
``(True, reason)`` (proposition holds) or ``(False, reason)`` (falsified).
These are *not* mathematical proofs in code — they are checkable statements
that correspond to proofs in the design document.  The code verifies the
premises hold; the proof itself is in the spec.

P-1  Termination        — finite budgets ⇒ guaranteed eventual termination.
P-2  Fixed point        — candidate set identical two rounds in a row ⇒
                          all subsequent rounds are identical (given a
                          deterministic evaluator).
